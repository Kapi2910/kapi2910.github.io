## Namaste üôèüèΩ

I am a second year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/). Currently, I research on crowd analytics using RF sensing. Additionally, I love collaborating and going beyond my defined role ‚Äî whether it's spending extra hours as a TA to help students gain confidence or contributing wherever I can to support those around me. Prior to my PhD, I graudted with a Bachelors degree from the [NIT, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) in the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering.

## Beyond My Academic Work

 I have a keen interest in Indian Knowledge Systems and often spend time exploring their rich intellectual traditions. I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and often spend my free time solving problems just for fun. I also enjoy playing chess and am always open to a good match on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AadityaP). Cooking is another passion of mine, and while I experiment in the kitchen, I occasionally share my creations on Instagram. If you like to chat about research, philosophy or eigenvalues, drop me a line via email.
