## Namaste

I am a second year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/). My research interests broadly include robot navigation and sensing. Currently, I am researching on crowd analytics using RF sensing. Prior to my PhD, I graduated with a Bachelors degree from the [NIT, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) in the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering.

## Beyond My Academic Work
I love cooking and you can count on me to make the best [pulihora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulihora) you have had. I also enjoy playing chess and am always open to a good match on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AadityaP). I have a keen interest in Indian Knowledge Systems and often spend time exploring their rich intellectual traditions. I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and often spend my free time solving problems just for fun. If you like to chat about research, philosophy or calculus, drop me a line via email.
