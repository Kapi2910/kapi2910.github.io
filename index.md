## Namaste

I am a second year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/). My research interests lie at the cusp of robotics, communication and sensing. Currently, I am researching on crowd analytics using RF sensing. Prior to my PhD, I graduated with a Bachelors degree from the [NIT, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) in the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering. 

Highlights of my research can be found in my [Publications page](./publications/). In my [Projects page](./projects/), you can find things that kept me busy outside of my PhD.

## Beyond My Academic Work
I love cooking and you can count on me to make the best Pulihora you have had. I also enjoy playing chess and am always open to a good match on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AadityaP). Apart from Dan Brown's books, I prefer reading non-fiction especially on the themes of philosophy or human behaviour. If you jam to Indian classical music casually, then you and I are going to be good friends. I also have a deep appreciation for mathematics and often spend some of my free time solving problems just for fun. 

If you like to chat, drop me a line via email.
